## DESCRIPTION:
Earn a surprise when you reach 3000 steps!

Free Star Baby is a cute animated pet that earns a surprise when you reach 3000 steps. The surprises include : frogs, cookies, donuts, giant glow stick, birthday, strawberries, and fast food. This adorable baby alien might remind you of a famous character, but he is totally different! He is from a star far away, and his name is Baby Garmi. This watch has more animations than my other models and a free special font.
